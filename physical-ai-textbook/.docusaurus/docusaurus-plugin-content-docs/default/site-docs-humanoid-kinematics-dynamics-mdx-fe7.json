  "description": "Building on the foundational concepts of kinematics and dynamics, this chapter applies these principles specifically to the intricate and high-dimensional systems of humanoid robots. Humanoids present unique challenges due to their many degrees of freedom (DoF), redundancy, and the inherent instability of bipedal locomotion.",
