  "description": "Locomotion is one of the most fundamental and challenging problems in humanoid robotics. Unlike wheeled robots, humanoids must actively maintain balance while moving, much like humans do. This chapter delves into the mechanics and control strategies behind various forms of humanoid locomotion, with a particular focus on bipedal walking.",
