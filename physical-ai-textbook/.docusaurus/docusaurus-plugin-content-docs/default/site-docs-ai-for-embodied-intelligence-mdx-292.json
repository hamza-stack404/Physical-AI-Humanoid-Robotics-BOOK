  "description": "Embodied Intelligence is a paradigm of artificial intelligence that posits that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent's body and its environment. It's a departure from the traditional view of AI as a disembodied \"brain in a vat\" that processes abstract symbols. For an embodied agent, the body is not just a passive shell; it is an active participant in the cognitive process.",
