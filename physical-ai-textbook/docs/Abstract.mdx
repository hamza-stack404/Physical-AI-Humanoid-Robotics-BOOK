# Abstract: The Dawn of Physical Intelligence

This textbook embarks on an exploration of **Physical AI**, a field at the confluence of artificial intelligence, robotics, and embodied cognition. For decades, artificial intelligence has been largely confined to the digital realm, mastering games and processing vast amounts of data. However, the next frontier of AI is physical. It is about creating intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the complex, dynamic, and unpredictable physical world.

The central thesis of this work is that true intelligence is **embodied**. An agent's physical form—its sensors, actuators, and morphology—is not merely a container for a disembodied "brain," but an integral part of its cognitive process. The way an agent interacts with the world shapes its learning, its understanding, and its very intelligence.

Our goal is to provide a unified framework for understanding and building these embodied intelligent systems. We will journey through the foundational principles of robotics—kinematics, dynamics, and control—that allow a machine to move and interact. We will then connect these principles to the cutting-edge of AI, exploring how machine learning, particularly deep learning and reinforcement learning, can endow these machines with the ability to learn from experience and adapt to new situations.

With a special focus on **humanoid robotics**, we will tackle the immense challenge of creating machines in our own image—robots that can navigate human-centric environments and collaborate with us in a natural and intuitive way.

This textbook is for the next generation of builders, thinkers, and pioneers who will create this future. It is a guide to the principles, technologies, and challenges that lie on the path to creating truly intelligent machines that are not just smart, but physically capable.
