# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Course – Full Book for Docusaurus Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical accuracy rooted in robotics, control theory, biomechanics, and AI research
### Progressive learning flow: beginner → intermediate → advanced humanoid robotics
### Hands-on applicability with clear explanations of real-world robotic systems
### High educational clarity suitable for students with CS/engineering backgrounds
### Modularity to fit a Docusaurus course structure (chapters → modules → lessons)

## Key Standards

- All technical statements must be backed by credible robotics/AI sources
- Citation style: IEEE
- Minimum 40% peer-reviewed research papers from robotics, biomechanics, and AI
- Diagrams, figures, and code samples must be original, reproducible and tested
- Mathematical formulas must follow LaTeX formatting
- Writing clarity must match engineering-course standards (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 12+)

## Content structure requirements

Multi-module book with at least 10 main chapters:

- Introduction to Physical AI
- Foundations of Robotics
- Sensors & Actuators
- Control Systems
- Robot Locomotion Mechanics
- Humanoid Kinematics & Dynamics
- Perception Systems (Vision, Audio, Tactile)
- AI for Embodied Intelligence
- Human-Robot Interaction
- Future of Physical AI & Case Studies

Each chapter must include:

- Learning outcomes
- Explanatory diagrams
- At least 2 examples or micro-projects
- References section

## Constraints

- Total length: 25,000–40,000 words
- Minimum 40 credible sources
- All content must be compatible with Docusaurus Markdown (MDX)
- Code blocks must follow syntax highlighting for Python, C++, and ROS
- Zero tolerance for plagiarism
- All figures must be exportable as SVG/PNG for Docusaurus

## Success Criteria

- Book compiles cleanly in Docusaurus with no broken links or MDX errors
- Content passes AI/robotics technical accuracy review
- All citations are verifiable and correctly formatted
- Course flow is intuitive and supports beginner-to-advanced progression
- Final book is publish-ready as a structured Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course
