Target audience: Students, engineers, and developers learning embodied intelligence, humanoid robotics, ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems. Designed for readers with basic AI/CS background but new to Physical AI. Focus: A complete end-to-end course and book that teaches Physical AI, humanoid robotics, simulation, ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA systems. Emphasis on bridging digital AI models to physical robotic systems through simulation (Gazebo, Unity, Isaac) and real hardware. Success criteria: Explains Physical AI and embodied intelligence with technical accuracy Provides a structured 12–13-week course converting into a full book Covers ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2, VLA, and Humanoid development Includes modules, weekly breakdowns, hardware architecture, and lab design Describes minimum three lab architectures: Local Workstation, Edge Kit, Cloud-Native Includes at least 25 credible sources (robotics, AI, SLAM, Isaac, ROS 2) Produces a full Docusaurus-ready book outline (MDX-compatible) All technical claims traceable to sources Student should understand how to simulate, control, and deploy humanoid robots after reading Constraints: Final output format: Markdown / MDX suitable for Docusaurus Length: 25,000–40,000 words Sources: Minimum 40 robotics/AI/Isaac/ROS-related publications, whitepapers, textbooks, or peer-reviewed papers Hardware sections must include accurate specs (GPU VRAM, CPU, RAM, Jetson models, sensor types) No plagiarism; all descriptions must be original Citations must follow IEEE style Include diagrams, architecture summaries, and module flowcharts (text placeholders allowed) Must align with the 4 major modules: ROS 2, Simulation, Isaac, VLA Not building: A robotics coding tutorial with full implementations of ROS 2 packages Step-by-step mechanical engineering CAD instructions A complete Isaac Sim, Unity, or Gazebo installation manual A deep research thesis on biomechanics or motor control Legal/ethical robotics risk analysis Full electrical engineering schematics for robot construction Included deliverables: Complete multi-module course book specification Weekly learning objectives and outcomes Hardware requirement specifications Sim rig architecture & cloud vs on-prem comparison Capstone final project specification: “Autonomous Humanoid” Edge computing flow (Jetson + sensors + ROS graph) Detailed explanations of ROS Nodes, URDF, SLAM, sensors, biped locomotion, perception pipelines, and VLA planning
